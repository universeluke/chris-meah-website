## Competition entry for Chris' website challenge

This is my (incomplete) entry of an AI-themed, future-oriented website for Chris' competition. I drew various mockups on Photoshop before starting, and I knew that I wanted to use the nodes of an LLM as a recurring theme throughout.

Starting with the navbar on the right, I was forced to learn a lot about SVG paths and CSS in general in order to make some of the effects that I wanted, and used Claude as a learning tool for some of the maths and logic. I'm not 100% happy with the homepage yet, and would like to tidy up some of the parallax and make the general flow of scrolling through the site a little easier.

There's a few areas that I'm really happy with, like the implementation of the 3D network model, and the burger menu at the bottom for navigation to other pages. I also really like the AI chatbot introduction, as that was actually my initial idea that lead into using the theme of LLMs throughout the whole site. The background dot-grid took some time to get right, but I'm also very happy with the subtle interactions it provides. I couldn't quite find the right font, and so have gone with Helvetica for now, but that will likely change in the future.

I have ideas for a highly visually engaging "wall of testimonials", and would also like to include more about Chris in the About Me section, as it's currently very bare-bones. I'd like in general to make the site more personal, and include more embedded videos and images throughout (instead of cards with text). The homepage desperately needs building out more, and needs more interactions and easy-to-access information in it, which would definitely be the next steps.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my submission!

(also: have a play with the 3D model, it's clickable and draggable and I span it around a lot whilst trying to come up with ideas. I mentioned in my submission that a seperate idea would be to have the entire site as a 3D model of a neural network, that is navigated through to access different areas, and I'd love to learn more about threejs and React Three Fiber in general!)

(also also: chris genuinely is an AI genius extraordinaire, but it's over-the-top on purpose and can definitely be changed if needed :P)
